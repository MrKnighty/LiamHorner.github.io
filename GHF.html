        <p>Gotta Have Faith is a 2.5D platformer bullet hell.</p>

        <h2>Project Info</h2>
        <p> This project was made with a group of 7 People; 1 Programmer, 2 Designers, 1 Audio, 3 Artists. This project had to be finished within 3 weeks </p>

        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        <p>I was the primary programmer for this assesment, i also designed the 1st level, and was the gameplay designer/balancer. Because of the size of this team, 
            I took the mantle of team leader.  I assigned jobs to the team, held standups daily, and checked in with everyone seeing if they needed more resources or time. I Managed when people where late
        and found soulutions solving that. Because i was not the sole designer, i had to make my dev tools easy to use for non programmers. this was a challenge for me, as i allways set up my dev tools to make 
    sense to the person who wrote that program. however for this i had to think from the prespective of a designer to ensure that the tools where easy to use. While the outcome was not great, i got a whole lot
    of experience and knoledge on making effective dev tools.  </p>

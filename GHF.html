        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Gotta Have Faith is a 2.5D platformer bullet hell game with minor roguelite elements. Your goal is to reach the end boss in every stage. However, you cannot damage any enemies directly. To defeat the bosses, you must dodge every attack they throw at you since the bosses take damage from casting spells at you. If you get hit by a spell, you give them a lot of health back.</p>
        
        <h2>Project Info</h2>
        <p>This project was completed by a team of seven people: 1 Programmer, 2 Designers, 1 Audio specialist, and 3 Artists, within a tight deadline of 3 weeks.</p>
        
        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        <p>I served as the primary programmer for this assessment and also designed the first level, in addition to handling gameplay design and balancing. Given the team's size, I took on the role of team leader. I assigned tasks, conducted daily stand-ups, and made sure everyone had the resources and time they needed. Managing the challenges of team members being late, I found solutions to keep the project on track. As I was not the only designer, I had to ensure that my development tools were user-friendly for non-programmers. This was a challenge, as I typically design tools to be intuitive for those who create them. For this project, I needed to adopt the perspective of a designer to make the tools accessible. While the project presented challenges, it offered me significant experience and knowledge in creating effective development tools.</p>
        <h2> My Thoughts</h2>

    <div class="game-description">
        <h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>
<p>This is a project I am not super proud of. This project ran into issues with team size and an unclear scope of the game. To put it simply, there were too many cooks in the kitchen. As the team leader and main developer, I was the one to put out fires.
While the game did fully fit into what was scoped out, I do not think it is a great product. Initially, for this project, I did not want to take the role as designer, as I wanted to focus on leadership and programming. Sadly, that was not the case,
I ended up having to take that mantle. As the designer I was working with, while they had good ideas, they did not know how to properly flesh them out or fully consider them. They basically left it up to me to figure it out. While I was not 
fully happy about that, I gained more experience on how designers and programmers should communicate, as well as skills in putting out fires. That's why I still consider this project when talking about what I have done; it was basically a big testing ground for me
to challenge myself as a leader and my overall game development knowledge. As if I want to eventually work in an indie studio, I will be putting on many different hats.</p>

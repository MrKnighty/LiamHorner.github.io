        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>Hi! my name is Liam Horner, I am a games programmer!</p>
        <p>I Am currently in my 3rd year of Uni, studying Bacholor of Software Engenerring, Game Programming. I am quite passionite about game development, primarly with game programming. For programing, i enjoy writing gameplay systems
            and writing AI's. I also enjoy designing games, naimly gameplay desing, and level design. Outside of that, i've allways found an intrest with lighting. i love to mess around with how lighting works, constantly trying different
            things to see how it looks. 
        </p>
        <p>Outside of GameDev, i love cooking! I take a chaotic aproach when cooking, choosing to mostly ignore recepies to experement with what works and what does not. While this mostly ends up poorly, i do end up coming up with some really good dishes!
        </p>
        <h2>Acomplishments </h2>
        <h3>2020: Certificte III in Game Design Foundations</h3>
        <p>This was the course that started my game development journy, my only experience in game development before,
            was Brackies make your first game youtube series. The only things i really got from this course is finding
            the things that i like
            and those are: Programming, Level Design, Gameplay Design, and Lighting. I very quickly discovered that i
            did not enjoy narative design.
        </p>
        <h3>2021: Certificte III in Game Development Foundations </h3>
        <p>This course fully locked me into game development, from this course i learned basic c# and how to use it in
            the Unity game engine.
        </p>
        <h3>2022-Present Bachorler of Software Engenerring, Game Programming </h3>
        <p>This is where i am at currently, I have learned many different skills throught this course. Naimly C/C++,
            OpenGL, Developent for PS5. I have also developed many different games for variouse assesments, which you
            can check out on the MyGames Page!
            With this course, i have been pushing myself constantly to learn new things and pick up new hats. One of the biggest things i had to teach myself was leadership skills. From the start of the course i made it a goal for myself to 
            learn leadership. to do this, every group project i was in i chose to be the leader. This was quite hard for me at first as i am an introvert, so leadership skills do not come natrually. But with constant effort i have leared good comumiaction skills,
            how to manage people and their deadlines. How to deal with problems on the fly, like missed deadlines, people droping out, and being the person to cut scope and set realistic goals.

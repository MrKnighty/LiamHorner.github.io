        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
   
            <p>Hi! My name is Liam Horner, and I am a game programmer. I am currently in my third year of university, studying for a Bachelor of Software Engineering with a focus on Game Programming. My initial drive for game development stemmed from my love for games. While I didn't start with a specific goal, I discovered my passion for programming during my Certificate III course. 
            I have skills in Unity, C#, C++, a bit of OpenGL, Unreal Engine 5, development for PS5, and starter knowledge in Godot. I also have beginner knowledge in data mining and machine learning. 
            After graduation, I plan to join a AAA game company to sharpen and hone my skills for at least five years. Eventually, I aspire to either start my own indie company or join an existing one to further pursue my creative ambitions.</p>
   
         
       
            <p>Outside of game development, I love cooking! I take a chaotic approach when cooking, choosing to mostly ignore recipes to experiment with what works and what does not. While this mostly ends up poorly, I occasionally come up with some really good dishes!</p>
  
            <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
            <h3>2020: Certificate III in Game Design Foundations</h3>
            <p>This was the course that started my journey in game development. Before this, my only experience was following Brackeys' "Make Your First Game" YouTube series. From this course, I discovered what I truly enjoyâ€”programming, level design, gameplay design, and lighting. I quickly realized that narrative design was not for me.</p>
            
            <h3>2021: Certificate III in Game Development Foundations</h3>
            <p>This course fully immersed me in game development. I learned basic C# and how to use it within the Unity game engine. Alhtought, my self taught knowledge from the last course made it so i did not really gain anything notible from this course. To me, it was just
                a comfimation on where i was headed
            </p>
            
            <h3>2022-Present: Bachelor of Software Engineering, Game Programming</h3>
            <p>I am currently enrolled in this program, where I have learned many different skills, namely C/C++, OpenGL, and development for the PS5. I have also developed many different games for various assessments, which you can check out on the My Games page! Throughout this course, I have been pushing myself to learn new things and take on new roles. One of the biggest challenges was teaching myself leadership skills. From the beginning, I aimed to be a leader in every group project. This was challenging at first, as I am an introvert, so leadership skills do not come naturally to me. However, with consistent effort, I have developed effective communication skills, learned how to manage people and their deadlines, and how to handle issues on the fly, like missed deadlines and team members dropping out. I've also become adept at cutting scope and setting realistic goals.</p>

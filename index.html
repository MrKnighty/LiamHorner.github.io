                <h3>Gotta Have Faith</h3>
                <p>Gotta Have Faith is a 2.5D platformer bullet hell game with minor roguelite elements. Your goal is to reach the end boss in every stage. However, you cannot damage any enemies directly. To defeat the bosses, you must dodge every attack they throw at you since the bosses take damage from casting spells at you. If you get hit by a spell, you give them a lot of health back.</p>

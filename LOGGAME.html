        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>LOG is a survival horror crafter. You are tasked with the objective of surviving and building your LOG cabin. You start in a forest with absolutely nothing. However, the forest is not what it seems. When you attempt to chop down a tree, you might discover it is a sentient tree! During the night, you will not be able to sleep, as you are under constant threat from the unwelcoming forest. Your only chance of survival is to build that cabin.</p>
    
        <h2>Project Info</h2>
        <p>This project was made as an assessment for my game development course. There were no specific requirements; we could make any game we wanted. The catch was that it had to be developed in just 3 weeks. The team comprised 2 Programmer/Designers, 1 3D Artist, and 1 2D Artist.</p>
    
        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        <p>Aside from the models and textures, this was primarily a two-person project, with me responsible for 50% of the programming, design, and sounds. My focus areas included the AI, player controller/interaction, resource harvesting, and log physics. In terms of design, I concentrated on the lighting and texturing style.</p>

        <h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>
        <p>This game was a massive challenge for me; this game had a much higher scope than any other project I have worked on before. The programming side was substantially more complex than all of my other projects combined. There were a lot more difficult programming challenges to solve.
            Normally when I have done AI in my previous games, it was in contained predictable scenarios. But since this game takes place in a massive play area, with different ways the player can approach enemies, making the AI convincingly challenging was substantially harder.
            The same goes for design as wellâ€”I have never designed a survival crafter game, let alone anything as complex as this. The number of different challenges with balancing resource placement, resource amounts, enemy amounts, etc., was overwhelming. Bottle that all up with a small team and time frame,
            it did not end up as we had hoped. The game is quite buggy, unpolished, and just not complete. But I am quite proud of it anyway; I learned a great deal from this project.</p>

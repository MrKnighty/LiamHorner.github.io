        <h2>Project Info</h2>
        <p> This project was made as an assesment for my game development course. This project had no requirements, we could make any game we wanted. Catch was it had to be developed in 3 weeks only.   </p>

        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        <p>Minus the Models and Textures, this was a 2 man project, with me doing 50% of the Programming, Design and Sounds. My areas of focus was the AI, Player Controller\Interaction, Resource harvesting, and log physics. As for the design, i focused 
            on the lighting, and texturing style. </p>

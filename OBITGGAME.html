        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One Boot in the Grave is a 2D roguelite inspired by Vampire Survivors. In this game, you must defeat increasingly difficult waves of enemies, each of whom will drop a boot. As you collect more boots, you will gain power and can upgrade or find new spells. As you progress, you can start creating your own unique builds.</p>
    
        <h2>Project Info</h2>
        <p>This project was made as an assessment for my game development course. It had to be loosely based on the themes "Cycle of Life," "Shoes in places they should not be," and "Unusual Aftermath" and was developed in just 3 weeks. I was in a team of 4, consisting of 1 Programmmer, 2 Artists, and 1 Writer, Music & Audio</p>
    
        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        <p>For this project, I was the solo developer and gameplay designer, while my teammates handled the art, music, and story. The game required significant balancing, which I managed, calculating various game states to ensure that different player builds were neither overpowered nor underpowered. The programming side wasnâ€™t particularly challenging as the game mechanics were straightforward. Instead, I focused on enhancing the development tools. I made the code robust enough to easily add new spells without affecting other parts of the code and developed complex wave logic to facilitate easy adjustments of wave difficulty through various parameters.</p>

        <h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>
        <p>I really enjoyed working on this project; this would have to be the only time that one of my projects was completely in scope. Even though I was not greatly challenged as a programmer, I could still test out my different skills, and focus more on 
            clean code. Although the game is quite simple, I am still quite proud of it as it's a full start-to-end complete game. I learned a lot of skills about how to polish a game, and how to build it to completion. I have found that this team size and skill set was really comfortable for me.
            I still took up the role as leader, but did not exactly feel like one. While I was still doing a lot of managing, everyone was working together perfectly and it felt like everyone had solid roles and was comfortable in them.</p>
